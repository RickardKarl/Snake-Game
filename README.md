# Snake-Game
An iteration of the classic snake game in Python that I created as a demonstration for kids during a programming camp. 

I used the the pre-installed package Turtle for the graphics which means you only need vanilla Python to run this code.

You use WASD to control the snake. You can change some parameters such as screensize in the code under "CLASS VARIABLES".

The Python version I used was 3.6.3
